# About JAPL

---

## **Introduction**

JAPL is a Python package designed to streamline the development
and simulation of computational models. By leveraging symbolic
representations using SymPy, JAPL enables the automatic generation
of both Python 'code and C++ extension modules from a universal
source code. These generated modules are seamlessly packaged to
operate with JAPL's core simulation framework, ensuring standardized
inputs and outputs across all models.

## **Purpose**

In many engineering and software development environments, multiple
simulation frameworks coexist, each with its own set of interfaces
and models. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies, inconsistencies,
and increased complexity when integrating and maintaining models.
JAPL addresses this problem by providing a unified approach:

* Universal Source Code: Models are defined symbolically, serving as
    a single source of truth.
* Automatic Code Generation: From the symbolic
    definitions, JAPL generates both Python and C++ code.
* Standardized Interfaces: The generated modules conform to a standardized
    interface, ensuring seamless integration with the core simulation framework.

By doing so, JAPL eliminates the need to manually adapt models to
different frameworks, reducing errors and saving valuable development time.

## **Key Features**

* Symbolic Modeling with SymPy: Utilize the power of symbolic mathematics to define functions and algorithms in an intuitive and high-level manner.
* Dual Code Generation: Generate both Python modules and C++ extension modules from the same symbolic source, offering flexibility and performance optimization.
* Seamless Integration: Automatically package generated modules to work flawlessly with JAPL's core simulation framework, promoting consistency.
* Standardized Inputs and Outputs: Ensure all models communicate using the same protocols, simplifying the simulation pipeline.
* Problem Solving: Address the issue of multiple simulation frameworks and disparate model interfaces within the workplace.

## **Limitations and Considerations**

While JAPL presents a robust solution to unify simulation frameworks and model interfaces, there are some potential cons and limitations to consider:

* Symbolic Computation Overhead: The process of symbolic computation can be resource-intensive, potentially impacting performance during model generation.
* Debugging Complexity: Automatically generated code, especially in C++, can be challenging to debug if issues arise, due to the abstraction from the original symbolic definitions.
* Dependency on SymPy: Reliance on a third-party library means that any bugs or limitations within SymPy could affect JAPL's functionality.
* Abstraction Limitations: High-level abstractions might hide important low-level details, which could be critical for certain engineering applications that need fine-grained control.
