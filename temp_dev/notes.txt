  - mode from expression differs from written test in test_MissileGeneric.
  The difference originates in the aerotable portion of the model where
  differences in how sympy and numpy convert a variable from degrees to
  radians. there's an (insignificant) delta of ~2.7e-17.

  something else may also be causing this because the errors grow with time.
